Some basic computer skills are necessary to use our customer management software. An outgoing personality with a positive attitude will help you start up conversations with strangers and being a self\\\\-starter will be useful as well so you can jump in and help wherever you see a need. You don’t need to have any previous experience or knowledge in paint or sales. We’ll teach you everything you need to know, which makes this a perfect starting point to launch your career.\n\n\nAs our PPS or Pro Paint Specialist with Behr, you’ll be working in a Home Depot store as a sales specialist focusing on professional painting contractors and their unique needs. On your own and working with the Pro Desk staff, you’ll meet and form relationships with local pros who rely on Behr for excellent products and exceptional customer service. You will build relationships with pros in the store who may be there for paint but are more likely there for something else. When an outside rep sends a contractor to you for paint, you will roll out the red carpet by collaborating with them to get exactly the right products for their needs, mix the paint, collect any sundry paint tools they need and get them in and out of the store quickly so they can get back to work. You will make our professional customers feel like they had a paint store experience.\n\n**Here’s what we’re looking for from you:**\n\n* An outgoing personality. You’ll will support the Home Depot Pro Desk and introduce yourself to any contractors. Get to know them, their business, and their needs. You’ll maintain this relationship and follow up regarding their jobs and any future needs.\n* Collaboration. You’ll work closely with Behr’s outside sales reps and take care of our customers when they come into the store, including pulling and tinting orders for pick up. You’ll also work closely with the Home Depot staff. We are all one team, so as their vendor you’ll be professional and helpful, working to maintain this mutually beneficial relationship.\n* Basic computer skills. You’ll enter all your new leads and contacts into Salesforce, our customer relationship management tool. We can train you on this program, but all prior computer knowledge is a plus.\n* Bilingual. You are not required to speak a second language, but many of our professional contractors do. If you have this knowledge, that’s definitely a bonus.\n* A completed high school education (High School Diploma or GED)\n\n**Here’s what we offer you:**\n\n* Competitive pay and bonus opportunities.

  "description": "To thrive as a Pro Sales Associate, you must be approachable, organized, and genuinely interested in helping our customers. Some basic computer skills are necessary to use our customer management software. An outgoing personality with a positive attitude will help you start up conversations with strangers and being a self\\\\-starter will be useful as well so you can jump in and help wherever you see a need. You don’t need to have any previous experience or knowledge in paint or sales. We’ll teach you everything you need to know, which makes this a perfect starting point to launch your career.\n\n  \n\nAs our Pro Sales Associate at Behr, you’ll be working in a Home Depot store as a sales specialist focusing on professional painting contractors and their unique needs. On your own and working with the Pro Desk staff, you’ll meet and form relationships with local pros who rely on Behr for excellent products and exceptional customer service. You will build relationships with pros in the store who may be there for paint but are more likely there for something else. When an outside rep sends a contractor to you for paint, you will roll out the red carpet by collaborating with them to get exactly the right products for their needs, mix the paint, collect any sundry paint tools they need and get them in and out of the store quickly so they can get back to work. You will make our professional customers feel like they had a paint store experience.\n\n  \n\nHere’s what we’re looking for from you:\n\n* An outgoing personality. You’ll support the Home Depot Pro Desk and introduce yourself to any contractors. Get to know them, their business, and their needs. You’ll maintain this relationship and follow up regarding their jobs and any future needs.\n* Collaboration. You’ll work closely with Behr’s outside sales reps and take care of our customers when they come into the store, including pulling and tinting orders for pick up. You’ll also work closely with the Home Depot staff. We are all one team, so as their vendor you’ll be professional and helpful, working to maintain this mutually beneficial relationship.\n* Basic computer skills. You’ll enter all your new leads and contacts into Salesforce, our customer relationship management tool. We can train you on this program, but all prior computer knowledge is a plus.\n* Bilingual. You are not required to speak a second language, but many of our professional contractors do. If you have this knowledge, that’s definitely a bonus.\n* A high school diploma or GED equivalent is required for all roles at Behr Paint Company.\n  \n\nHere’s what we offer you:\n\n* Competitive pay and bonus opportunities. Sell more gallons \\\\= more money!\n* Accrue 15 paid days off the first year.\n* 401(k) retirement plan with 4% match.\n* Competitive health plans for individuals and families.\n* Check out behr.com\/careers to view a comprehensive list of our benefits and perks.\n  \n\nFounded in 1947, Behr Paint Company is one of the largest manufacturers of paints, primers, decorative finishes, stains, surface preparation, and application products for do\\\\-it\\\\-yourselfers and professionals in the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, and Chile.

You don’t need to have any previous experience or knowledge in paint or sales. We’ll teach you everything you need to know, which makes this a perfect starting point to launch your career.\n\n\nAs our PPS or Pro Paint Specialist with Behr, you’ll be working in a Home Depot store as a sales specialist focusing on professional painting contractors and their unique needs. On your own and working with the Pro Desk staff, you’ll meet and form relationships with local pros who rely on Behr for excellent products and exceptional customer service. You will build relationships with pros in the store who may be there for paint but are more likely there for something else. When an outside rep sends a contractor to you for paint, you will roll out the red carpet by collaborating with them to get exactly the right products for their needs, mix the paint, collect any sundry paint tools they need and get them in and out of the store quickly so they can get back to work. You will make our professional customers feel like they had a paint store experience.\n\n\nHere’s what we’re looking for from you:\n\n* An outgoing personality. You’ll will support the Home Depot Pro Desk and introduce yourself to any contractors. Get to know them, their business, and their needs.

You’ll work closely with Behr’s outside sales reps and take care of our customers when they come into the store, including pulling and tinting orders for pick up. You’ll also work closely with the Home Depot staff. We are all one team, so as their vendor you’ll be professional and helpful, working to maintain this mutually beneficial relationship.\n* Basic computer skills. You’ll enter all your new leads and contacts into Salesforce, our customer relationship management tool. We can train you on this program, but all prior computer knowledge is a plus.\n* Bilingual. You are not required to speak a second language, but many of our professional contractors do. If you have this knowledge, that’s definitely a bonus.\n\n\nHere’s what we offer you:\n\n* Competitive pay and bonus opportunities.

Some basic computer skills are necessary to use our customer management software. An outgoing personality with a positive attitude will help you start up conversations with strangers and being a self\\\\-starter will be useful as well so you can jump in and help wherever you see a need. You don’t need to have any previous experience or knowledge in paint or sales. We’ll teach you everything you need to know, which makes this a perfect starting point to launch your career.\n\n  \n\nAs our Pro Sales Associate at Behr, you’ll be working in a Home Depot store as a sales specialist focusing on professional painting contractors and their unique needs. On your own and working with the Pro Desk staff, you’ll meet and form relationships with local pros who rely on Behr for excellent products and exceptional customer service. You will build relationships with pros in the store who may be there for paint but are more likely there for something else. When an outside rep sends a contractor to you for paint, you will roll out the red carpet by collaborating with them to get exactly the right products for their needs, mix the paint, collect any sundry paint tools they need and get them in and out of the store quickly so they can get back to work. You will make our professional customers feel like they had a paint store experience.\n\n  \n\nHere’s what we’re looking for from you:\n\n* An outgoing personality. You’ll support the Home Depot Pro Desk and introduce yourself to any contractors. Get to know them, their business, and their needs. You’ll maintain this relationship and follow up regarding their jobs and any future needs.\n* Collaboration. You’ll work closely with Behr’s outside sales reps and take care of our customers when they come into the store, including pulling and tinting orders for pick up. You’ll also work closely with the Home Depot staff. We are all one team, so as their vendor you’ll be professional and helpful, working to maintain this mutually beneficial relationship.\n* Basic computer skills. You’ll enter all your new leads and contacts into Salesforce, our customer relationship management tool. We can train you on this program, but all prior computer knowledge is a plus.\n* Bilingual. You are not required to speak a second language, but many of our professional contractors do. If you have this knowledge, that’s definitely a bonus.\n* A high school diploma or GED equivalent is required for all roles at Behr Paint Company.\n  \n\nHere’s what we offer you:\n\n* Competitive pay and bonus opportunities.

You’ll also work closely with the Home Depot staff. We are all one team, so as their vendor you’ll be professional and helpful, working to maintain this mutually beneficial relationship.\n* Basic computer skills. You’ll enter all your new leads and contacts into Salesforce, our customer relationship management tool. We can train you on this program, but all prior computer knowledge is a plus.\n* Bilingual. You are not required to speak a second language, but many of our professional contractors do. If you have this knowledge, that’s definitely a bonus.\n\n**Here’s what we offer you:**\n\n* Competitive pay and bonus opportunities. Sell more gallons \\\\= more money!\n* Accrue 15 paid days off the first year.\n* 401(k) retirement plan with 4% match.\n* Competitive health plans for individuals and families.\n* Check out behr.com\/careers to view a comprehensive list of our benefits and perks.\n\n\nFounded in 1947, Behr Paint Company is one of the largest manufacturers of paints, primers, decorative finishes, stains, surface preparation, and application products for do\\\\-it\\\\-yourselfers and professionals in the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, and Chile.

You will build relationships with pros in the store who may be there for paint but are more likely there for something else. When an outside rep sends a contractor to you for paint, you will roll out the red carpet by collaborating with them to get exactly the right products for their needs, mix the paint, collect any sundry paint tools they need and get them in and out of the store quickly so they can get back to work. You will make our professional customers feel like they had a paint store experience.\n\n**Here’s what we’re looking for from you:**\n\n* An outgoing personality. You’ll will support the Home Depot Pro Desk and introduce yourself to any contractors. Get to know them, their business, and their needs. You’ll maintain this relationship and follow up regarding their jobs and any future needs.\n* Collaboration. You’ll work closely with Behr’s outside sales reps and take care of our customers when they come into the store, including pulling and tinting orders for pick up. You’ll also work closely with the Home Depot staff. We are all one team, so as their vendor you’ll be professional and helpful, working to maintain this mutually beneficial relationship.\n* Basic computer skills. You’ll enter all your new leads and contacts into Salesforce, our customer relationship management tool. We can train you on this program, but all prior computer knowledge is a plus.\n* Bilingual. You are not required to speak a second language, but many of our professional contractors do. If you have this knowledge, that’s definitely a bonus.\n\n**Here’s what we offer you:**\n\n* Competitive pay and bonus opportunities. Sell more gallons \\\\= more money!\n* Accrue 15 paid days off the first year.\n* 401(k) retirement plan with 4% match.\n* Competitive health plans for individuals and families.\n* Check out behr.com\/careers to view a comprehensive list of our benefits and perks.\n\n**Location**\n\n\n1155 Bell Rd\n\n\nAntioch, TN 37013\n\n\nFounded in 1947, Behr Paint Company is one of the largest manufacturers of paints, primers, decorative finishes, stains, surface preparation, and application products for do\\\\-it\\\\-yourselfers and professionals in the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, and Chile.

So we give higher than average vacation time, and we'll even help you plan out your life so you can actually use that vacation time.*\n\n**Compensation and Benefits**\n\nWhat do we currently have to offer?\n\n* $17\\\\.00\/Hour (Plus Commission).\n* If you're not good at it, you'll make **$17\\\\.00\/Hour**\n* If you're decent\/good at it, you'll make closer to **$30\\\\.00\/Hour**\n* If you're great at it, you'll make **$50\\\\+\/Hour**\n* We've got a super simple process for the job that works, and we'll teach you how to do it, and will teach you quickly so you can go out and start making money.\n* Obviously if you don't do your job, we're gonna have to talk to see what the problem is, but you'll be working with good people who are respectful.\n\nWhat future opportunities do we have to offer?\n\n* Potential for promotions and lateral changes within the company\n* Ongoing training and coaching to help you evolve both at work and on a personal level\n* Growth potential in the form of overseeing and managing other team members with increased pay\n* Take home vehicle\n* Health and Retirement benefits\n* The opportunity to grow with the business\n\n**What is our Mission?**\n\nWe are redefining the culture of contractor work to one of integrity, professionalism and opportunity for everyone who works with us. Right now the construction industry sucks, and everyone knows it. Contractors are unreliable, untrustworthy, and have little or no integrity. Opportunity in the trades is like trying to find Waldo in a sea of barbershop quartets and American flags. We’re changing that.\n\nWe operate with integrity. That means we won’t quit; on our customers, on you, or on each other. You’ll be able to have pride in your work because we take quality seriously too. If this position is a great fit for you, awesome! We want someone who fits well, but if it isn't a great fit, we aren't going to try to force it. After all, life is short and we want you to be happy too.\n\nSometimes you’re going to make mistakes here. That’s okay. Learn from them and we’ll grow together as a team! Your team will have your back, and you can have theirs without having to worry about constant CYA.\n\nWe learn through breakdowns. Sometimes customers may be unhappy. We will assess every situation from a point of curiosity and accountability to figure out what it will take to fix it and not make the same mistakes over and over again.\n\nWe are committed to your success.

Naturally as your leadership skills develop, increased opportunities within the company will also present themselves!\n\n**What is the job?**\n\nWe’ll talk more about it down the line in the process if you’re selected, but here is a little about the position:\n\n* In\\\\-field door to door marketing with homeowners looking to paint their home\n* No pressure to sell, you are just collecting information\n* Collecting home owner info for appointments to be set by our Office staff for our Sales team.\n* 90% of your time is spent going door to door collecting potential customer information, meeting with potential customers, and positively representing the Company image in our community neighborhoods\n* 10% of your time is spent on team building, meetings, trainings, and administrative tasks. \\\\*You aren't required to be in any meetings that don't provide value to you, and we actively try to avoid holding meetings that \"could've been an email\"\\\\*\n* Heavily focused on personal and professional training \\\\& development\n* No Experience Needed. We'll teach you how to do it (and it's super simple)!\n\n**This might be a good fit for you if:**\n\n* You Genuinely care about your community, customers, and team members, and love interacting with new people\n* You are an optimist and have a positive attitude. Can maintain a smile after being told \"No\"\n* You are competitive and love the thrill of outperforming others in your role\n* You are very focused on personal training and development and investing in yourself\n* You are very driven, motivated, and ambitious. A “Go\\\\-getter”\n* You have an outstanding track record of results\n* You are coachable and able to take constructive criticism in stride\n\nThis is a position with a flexible schedule. We can work with your schedule, and by doing so you'll have the ability to work full time, part time, weekends, evenings, or whatever schedule works best for you! While you aren't required to work a set schedule, you'll be coordinating your schedule and routes ahead of time, and some days\/times will yield better results than others because of prospective customer availability. The Door to Door Marketing Rep is the person accountable for providing accurate potential customer information to help keep the schedule filled for the Sales team, and ultimately keep the schedule filled for our Painting teams. *Most* work will be done in Albuquerque but this position may require driving to and from the Albuquerque Metro Areas (Bernalillo, Rio Rancho, etc.) as well on occasion.\n\nQualifications and Requirements\n\nPositive Attitude\n\nFun to be around\n\nDoor to door experience not required, but preferred\n\nProven track record of success\n\nStrong communication skills\n\nStrong work ethic, ambitious\n\nSelf\\\\-motivated and results oriented\n\nAbility to work independently\n\nTechnical knowledge of the painting trade is not absolutely necessary, but would give you a \"leg up\" in answering potential customers' questions.\n\nWe have a few company vehicles and are actively working on getting more, but we currently do not have a company vehicle for this position, so you must have reliable transportation with current insurance. In order to be considered, you must have a clean and valid driver's license with no restrictions, and must have a working smartphone.\n\nIf you are currently working with a local painter or for another painting company in or around Albuquerque, we can be discreet about communication if necessary.
